**Calendar**

https://samchanthunder.github.io/calendar/

I created a calendar from scratch as a two hour project. I used a 2D array to keep track of what days should appear and where it should appear on the selected month. I also made it so you can select a day, showing that each button(day) can have its own respective function based on what day, month, and year it is.
